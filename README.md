# LUA_MutlipleShortcutMenus
Provides access to 5 different shortcut menus that are customizable in-game, using L3/R3 to cycle up/down, or L1+D-pad direction &amp; L1+L2.

Writing/Using A Shortcut Menu:
Button combos are listed in the Pause menu, and will change to reflect the current controller detected. (May not work in Enemy/Boss Rando)
Add shortcuts to a set by adding magic/items to the customize menu, then pressing L3/R3 to cycle up and down. Quickly back out of the menu and enter it to display the changes.

Shortcuts do NOT persist between save files. 
To use the same shortcut sets across different save files, press R1+Select (PS4/5 controller) to save all your shortcut sets from one save file.
Then load into your other save file & press L1+L2+R1+R2+Select to load all your shortcut sets at once.

Scrolling through each set with L3/R3 in-game is possible as well.

Button combos (PS4/5 Controller) are:
L1+D-pad Up: Shortcut Set #1
L1+D-Pad Right: Shortcut Set #2
L1+D-Pad Down: Shortcut Set #3
L1+D-Pad Left: Shortcut Set #4
L1+L2: Shortcut Set #5
